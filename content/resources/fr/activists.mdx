Activists play a crucial role in Logos. You help translate decentralised technology into real-world impact, empower communities, identify threats to civil liberties, and create local strategies that advance autonomy and freedom.

If you're interested in contributing to Logos as an activist, you can submit a proposal [via the proposal form](/proposals).

<br />

## Attend a Circle IRL or Start One

- Join a Logos Circle in your city to connect with other organisers, technologists, artists, and researchers.

- If there isn’t one near you, you can apply to start a Circle and receive support with
  - onboarding
  - event structure
  - communication materials
  - support on local outreach.

[Find a Circle](https://luma.com/logosevents) in a city near you, or [schedule a call](https://cal.com/team/logos-onboarding/intro?overlayCalendar=true) to discuss starting a Circle.

## Contribute to Winnable Issues

Winnable issues are practical, achievable projects that directly improve people’s lives, and are developed through a Circle to ensure community ownership, local insight, and real-world impact.

As an activist, you can contribute by:

- Helping with research, organising, and executing the next steps
- Coordinating volunteers
- Connecting your issue with relevant groups, journalists, or organisations
- Documenting progress and sharing outcomes.

[Find winnable issues](https://contribute.logos.co/en/issues/) to contribute to.

## Follow Logos Forum Threads

The Logos Forum is where Circle stewards and contributors:

- share detailed updates
- document progress
- propose new winnable issues
- coordinate between cities
- post research, case studies, and ideas.

[Following the forum](https://forum.logos.co/) helps you understand what's happening across the network and where your input can make the greatest impact.
