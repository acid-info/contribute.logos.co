Logos is a passionately open-source, value-aligned community that is the product of our collective efforts. We build, learn, experiment, and succeed together.

As an open-source project, Logos is not just a collection of individual contributors; it’s a civic body. We organise voluntarily to solve problems, uphold values, and build institutions that serve the common good, individual freedom, and collective prosperity.

Our culture is based on meritocracy, shared ownership, common responsibility, and transparent governance. Contributions to the community – code, content, ideas – are recognised and rewarded through roles that enable deeper participation in the network.

If you're interested in contributing to Logos as a developer, create a post with your proposal in the [Logos forum](https://forum.logos.co/).
