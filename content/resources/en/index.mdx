Logos is a sovereign decentralised technology stack that realises the latent cypherpunk vision of autonomous digital territories, also referred to as temporary autonomous zones, meta-havens, cyberstates, or more recently network states. While traditional cypherspaces like Tor and I2P created “wilderness” through anonymous communication networks, Logos adds an internal plurality of orders through privacy-preserving blockchain consensus.

This combination establishes a new kind of territory in cyberspace: a supra-jurisdictional “cypherstate” that can deploy stable, corruption-resistant institutions to anyone, anywhere.

The system’s technical foundation is a hybrid microkernel-microservices architecture that initially combines three existing core protocols:

- **Communication**: Anonymous communication networks for state-adversary-resistant messaging

- **Storage**: Decentralised storage for coercion-resistant, persistent data, filesharing, and application distribution

- **Blockchain**: Privacy-preserving blockchain for sovereign order and governance

Applications communicate using self-describing RDF-star data formats, enabling nodes to dynamically discover and load modules while maintaining privacy. This plugin-based architecture allows the network to evolve and adapt, creating an impartial medium for agreements between parties, from individuals to civil society organisations to nation states.

The architecture enables competitive governance, where institutions must earn support by actually improving people’s lives. By combining maximal privacy preservation with runtime composability, it provides a foundation for parallel institutions that remain resistant to capture and corruption – whether deployed bottom-up by civil society or top-down by state actors.

As an open-source project, Logos is not just a collection of individuals. We come together by choice to address shared challenges, advance our principles, and create systems that benefit the whole through open contributions.
