Logos is a passionately open-source, value-aligned community that is the product of our collective efforts. We build, learn, experiment, and succeed together.

As an open-source project, Logos is not just a collection of individual contributors – it’s a civic body. We organise voluntarily to solve problems, uphold values, and build institutions that serve the common good: individual freedom and collective prosperity.

Our culture is based on meritocracy, shared ownership, common responsibility, and transparent governance. Contributions to the community – code, content, ideas – are recognised and rewarded through roles that enable deeper participation in the network.

If you're interested in contributing to Logos as a developer, you can submit a proposal via the [proposal form](/proposals).
