Everyday people working to improve lives at the local level play a crucial role in Logos. You help translate decentralised technology into real-world impact, empower communities, identify threats to civil liberties, and create local strategies that advance autonomy and freedom.

If you're interested in contributing to Logos at the local level, create a post with your proposal in the [Logos forum](https://forum.logos.co/).

# Attend a Circle IRL or start one

Join a Logos Circle in your city to connect with other organisers, technologists, artists, and researchers.

If there isn’t one near you, you can apply to start a Circle and receive support with:

- Onboarding.
- Event structure.
- Communication materials.
- Support with local outreach.

[Find a Circle](https://luma.com/logosevents) in a city near you, or [schedule a call](https://cal.com/team/logos-onboarding/intro?overlayCalendar=true) to discuss starting a Circle.

# Contribute to winnable issues

Winnable issues are practical, achievable projects that directly improve people’s lives, and are developed through a Circle to ensure community ownership, local insight, and real-world impact.

As a Circle contributor, you can contribute by:

- Helping with research, organising, and executing new and ongoing initiatives.
- Coordinating volunteers.
- Connecting your issue with relevant groups, journalists, or organisations.
- Documenting progress and sharing outcomes.

[Find winnable issues](https://contribute.logos.co/en/issues/) to contribute to.

- Propose new winnable issues.
- Coordinate between cities.
- Post research, case studies, and ideas.
